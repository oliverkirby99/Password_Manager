# Password_Manager
Check the .README for details. Login, add/view passwords. Password file is encrypted.

You need Python and run 'pip install cryptography' in cmd/terminal

Password is admin

the KEY file is required for encryption/decryption. Although, that makes the program really unsafe.

When you add an account you enter:
the account name/type (e.g. facebook, bank, email etc.)
the username
the password
confirm password

You can then view all the details using the 'view' function.

If you try to read the files in the passwords.txt file, you cannot read the password.
